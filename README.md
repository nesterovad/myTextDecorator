This is a pet project - a small React app with outsource and custom components which lets format text with graphic ui and export it with appropriate html tags

Why: sometimes it's needed to format text with html (i.e. for posting text on ao3), but it's too boring to do it by hands. It also provides some special options like replasing hyphen with dash

Future plans:
<ul>
  <li>
  refactoring:
    <ul>
      <li>creating class-style written version</li>
      <li>adding Redux (mostly for practice, in real-life it's not reasonable to use it for such small apps)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>adding tests</li>
  <li>building</li>
</ul>

How to run current version:
<ol>
  <li>be shure you have npm</li>
  <li>download code from main branch</li>
  <li>run with npm start</li>
</ol>
In some minutes it will run in a browser window
